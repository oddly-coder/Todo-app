The useState hook is a great way to manipulate states in react because it is easier to implement and makes our code cleaner unlike using the ‘this.state’ method in the class component in react.
    In this little project, I used the useState hook by setting the default or initial state data to a hardcoded list of 
object data in data.json and updating the state every time a task is crossed, uncrossed, updated using the form or when the completed tasks are cleared.
